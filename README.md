“SystemHandler” Project Overview, ver 1.00

SystemHandler is a project package that creates a localized multi-class SSO system that handles user input and program output on the terminal.  This project is meant to show an understanding of interacting systems handling various user inputs.  This version of the SystemHandler has the capability to handle (i) user account creations and logins, including limited customization; (ii) and security query creation and challenges.  While it currently has limited capability, the structure of the implemented systems allow for easier and integrated expansion of the SystemHandler package without affecting the basic function of already-implemented systems and methods.

The SystemHandler package relies heavily upon HashMap data structures utilizing (i) lambda expressions which execute Runnable objects containing critical methods; (ii) User account storage including User objects, passwords, and usernames; (iii) and security queries with specifically-corresponding User account answers.
